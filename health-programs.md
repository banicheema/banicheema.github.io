To have gainful impact and improve our effectiveness, it is essential for us to use a community based approach and build a sustainable model for health education.

Under our programs we work towards addressing high priority issues and provide quality service to the people. We are always seeking new partnerships to expand the program to provide health education and assistance to underprivileged children and families.

In the past we have worked in partnership to share health education information with students attending government schools in the City of Chandigarh, focusing on awareness, prevention and wellness. As well as integrate preventive eye health care into our program for the visually impaired as a campaign to end avoidable blindness in India.

The foundation took the health initiative forward by developing it into a prevention and wellness program that continues to share knowledge and provide awareness on urban health issues to children, youth and families living in poverty.
