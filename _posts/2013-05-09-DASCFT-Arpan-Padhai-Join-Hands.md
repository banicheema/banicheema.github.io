On May 19, DASCFT ,in collaboration with volunteers from Arpan - PADHAI (CSR Initiative by Infoscions), conducted a health project in Shastri Nagar.

At this rural colony in Chandigarh, our team spread awareness among kids(about 50) on healthy living practices & personal hygiene.

Arpan - PADHAI for the past one year has been involved in assisting these kids on academic front. We plan to take this partnership forward for the all-round development of these kids and their colony.
