“It is said that India lives in villages but the living conditions are not good,” he admitted. Mr. Bansal said there was a demand for bringing farming under tax net but the union government was not prepared for it. He said that NGOs like Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation trust should spread the message to the farmers to avail various schemes of farm credit available to them from the banks. To a suggestion by Trust chairman Jagdeep Singh Cheema, regarding the entry of corporate into agriculture where they may have farmers as share-holders or partners, he said the farmers would have to work together to realize the.

Satish C. Jha, Member, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, in his keynote address expressed concern about the agricultural growth in Punjab & Haryana which was less than one per cent. He also expressed concern are the excessive mechanization of farms which had reduced the labor absorption capacity resulting in severe implications for poverty. Moreover, 78 per cent of all the farm households in Punjab were under debt.

This trend must halt at its earliest, he added. Meanwhile, a release issued by the SBI said it had actively participated in the seminar. It further said that SBI’s farm credit which was Rs.1,193 crores in March 2004 had reached Rs. 2,274 crores in March 2006.
