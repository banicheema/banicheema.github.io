On March 6, 2016 DASCFT helped organize a General Health Check-up Camp for children upto 16 years of age in partnership with Bhumi as part of their Festivol celebrations. The Camp was held adjacent to the Slums near Mansa Devi Temple, Panchkula. In addition to the physical height and weight measurements, the kids were checked for general as well as chronic ailments. Some medical students also volunteered for the event.  A Door-to-door campaign was held for maximum outreach during the Camp.  We would distribute medicines as and when necessary, making sure that misuse of the medicines does not take place at any cost.

Number of children checked: Around 300

Number of Volunteers: 25

Number of Doctors: 7 (1 Paediatrician and 6 General Physicians)
