On July 21st, 2012 DASCFT launched a health awareness program with a focus to continue to help children attending government schools in and around the city of Chandigarh, U.T. to learn about personal hygiene, keeping their environment clean (also includes water and sanitation) and soft skills.

We are currently working with students from 4th grade, age group 8-10 years and will slowly expand the program to other classes at the school. The total population of the school is approx. 3000 students. Through this program health camps will also be organized as per need of the students to improve their health status.

The idea is to promote a healthy living standard for students as well as their families through preventive care information.
