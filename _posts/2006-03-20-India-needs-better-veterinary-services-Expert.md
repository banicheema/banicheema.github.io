Mr H.S. Chatha, Haryana Agriculture, Dairy Development and Fisheries Minister, yesterday stressed the need for creating more awareness among farmers about veterinary services. He was addressing a refresher workshop on dairy veterinary practices organised by the Dr Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation Trust.

Dr Arun P Phatak, an Indian-American animal husbandry expert, said in India the dairy profession had problems on account of longer dry periods, irregular pregnancies and lack of feed and disease management.

The Director-General of the Animal Husbandry, Haryana, Dr K.S. Dangi, regretted though India was the largest producer of milk in the world yet the yield per acre was not at the desired level. To ensure better milk yield, better veterinary services were needed, he added.
