Chandigarh: Under the development initiative of Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation Trust, a health education program was launched in the Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 10, on Saturday.

The focus of the programme is to help children attending government schools learn about personal hygiene, keeping the environment clean and help improve their social conduct. The initiative is working with 200 children from Class 4 who are in the age group of 8-10 years.

“The idea is to create awareness through talks (assisted with power point presentations), workshops and camps that will improve the health status of children. The main aim of the programme would be to promote a healthy living standard through preventive care,” said Bani Cheema who is undertaking the initiative.
