*I feel heavenly to get a chance to record books for visually impaired students. These recording sessions have been very close to my heart from day one onwards as it has  taught me a lot. When I was 19 I went to a blind school & suddenly I felt ashamed that we have everything in totality - but yet we always complaint or make excuses . From that very day, I wanted to do something fruitful but did not knew how ? Cheema Trust and Foundation gave me a platform and I decided to give my best to this noble foundation who actually works at the core problem faced by visually impaired. I would like to congratulate each member who is associated with this foundation in any way as this foundation is doing really a great job that too without publicising it.*

*Recording books for these enthusiastic gems of society that teach us - Have faith in God & never let your DREAMS be broken , just fight for it with high spirit  I feel gleeful that Cheema trust became their strength & gave us a chance to be a part on this journey.
I believe my little effort will help them in accomplishing their dreams. Rotaract Club Of Chandigarh is always available to this foundation .*

*I am so happy to share that in the year 2017-2018 ( May) my team of 53 rotaractors accomplished the aim of recording 217 hours and we all are immensely happy to do the same.*
