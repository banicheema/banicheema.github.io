We live in a world of inequality. Not all of us have the same opportunities or the same quality of life. That is why our duty as people and citizens is to help those who don’t have this chance. In this process, I have discovered that what we give to others does not compare with the gratification received in return, which is a lot more. I am are here to help but I also strongly believe that there is much more I have learnt and discovered through this process that has made me grow and become a better person. Our ideas, our efforts and our determination is enough to make a change not only in our society but also in our selves.  Dr. Amrik S. Cheema Foundation Trust has opened the door to such an opportunity and helped me strengthen my commitment to help people in need.

Details of campaign
On November 21, 2012 our team began the health education initiative with the 5th grade while holding a separate revision program for the 4th graders. Under this program we are now working with close to 450 students and hope to continue expanding the program. So far we have covered topics such as personal hygiene, environment, water and sanitation and proper garbage disposal including separation of waste such as recycling and so on.

As an end of year activity we rewarded 12 students from the 4th grade to encourage all students to continue practicing what they have so far learnt from the program.

We thank our volunteers who have helped and supported this project through their dedication and hardwork at the school. This program owes its success to the entire team including students from YPS Mohali, and colleges around the city as well as working professionals.

Through this program we hope to create awareness amongst the youth, of socio economic issues faced by the underprivileged in our country.
