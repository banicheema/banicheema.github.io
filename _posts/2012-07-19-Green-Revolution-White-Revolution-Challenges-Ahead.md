Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation Trust organized a seminar on 18th July, 2012 commemorating the 30th Death Anniversary of Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema, who was Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agriculture University and Agriculture Commissioner of India. The foundation trust organized a seminar “Green Revolution – White Revolution, Challenges Ahead”. The seminar was attended by eminent personalities such as Ms. Shabana Azmi, Sh. Gulzar Singh Ranike, Agriculture Minister of Punjab, Sh. Paramvir Singh, Agriculture Minister of Haryana, Dr. B.S. Dhillon, Vice Chancellor, Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, Sh. Dilip Gosain, NDRI, Karnal and BK Laxmi Behen of the Brahma Kumaris.

Ms. Shabana Azmi inaugurated the seminar at 11 am. In her address Ms. Azmi expressed her satisfaction over the spirit of the function organized and was happy to note that such programmes on women empowerment and agriculture are being regularly organized by the Trust. Appreciating the efforts of Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema, she spoke of the Green Revolution starting from his tenure, stating that even Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema could not have anticipated the extent of the success of the Green Revolution. Ms. Azmi demanded that the government subsidies for seeds, pesticides, fertilizers should be given directly to the farmers. She was speaking in the favour of organic farming and desired only the general fodder should be supplied for the good health of cattle. She also urged the authorities to have a central body which could certify the geneunity of material supplied to farmers. She was in favour of taking steps for the betterment of small farmers with small land holdings because the major chunk of profit was swallowed by the big landlords.

Shifting to the topic of women empowerment, Ms. Azmi expressed the need for upliftment of women in society and mentioned that even in the field women workers out number the male workers. She advised that society cannot make phenomenal growth unless the status of women is improved. Brahma Kumari Laxmi Behen while addressing the gathering, highlighted the role of NGOs like the Trust for awakening the spirit of development and growth amongst the neglected sectors of the economy. She connected the concept of divinity with the farming culture and assured the farmers that much could be achieved through meditation and farming.

Sh. Bhagwan Das Gupta, veteran journalist and office bearer of Young Farmer’s Association, Patiala, talked about how dedicated Dr. Cheema was towards agriculture and how he would not mind taking personal risk for experimenting new techniques, new variety of seeds, new ways of irrigation. He said Dr. Cheema was the protagonist of the Green Revolution after the launching of which the agriculture production jumped in substantial heights in quantity as well as quality. The concept of Green Revolution became a household concept later and became the backbone of improved agriculture production. He termed Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema as one of the most simple, dedicated, daring and a religious personality.

Minister for Animal Husbandry, Punjab, S. Gulzar Singh Ranike said that there is a need for the country to become self sufficient in food production as the inflation in the price of food was disproportionate to the income of people. “We need to breed our own animals as dairy farming is much more remunerative then agriculture. Diversification is very important, the government is planning to set up cattle fields and 200 hospitals for cattle.”

Paramvir Singh, Agriculture Minister, Haryana spoke about the problems facing the state in agriculture. “There is less productivity of land, and the ground water is receding, in addition to an increase in the cost factor in agriculture. Soil health cards have been issued to farmers, which certifies the health of the soil,” he said.

Soon after the seminar, Mr. Gulzar Singh Ranike, Minister of Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development of Punjab announced a sum of Rs. 93 crore for the dairy farming to increase milk production in the state.
