At Dr. Amrik Singh Cheema Foundation Trust (DASCFT) we believe in Public Private Partnership, partnerships with local NGOs to work together to solve identified problems for sustainability. Also seeking help of government and corporate sector we hope to maximize resources and increase awareness of the problems in the communities.

Objectives of the trust

1. To promote community development with emphasis on the development of human capabilities, the trust empowers the visually impaired by providing them a gateway to higher education through audio learning materials.
2. To enhance the lives of women and children by providing them with tools to improve their health, social and economic status
3. Through yearly seminars address issues and revitalize participation of rural farmers, especially women to meet the growing challenges and take advantage of the growing economy
4. To ensure that farmers have an active role in managing the development process in their villages

__DASCFT would like to partner and provide service to other NGOs that require help in creating awareness about their programs by providing help with Grant writing, networking and advocacy skills__
