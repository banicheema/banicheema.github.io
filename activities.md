Our motive is to empower rural women in Punjab and Haryana, through economic opportunities in the agriculture sector. We hope to improve their health status with a focus on ending female feticide, creating awareness on health education in areas of HIV/AIDS and combating the growing problem of drug addiction.

This training center is in the development stage and the project will be completed by 2019. First of its kind in the states of Haryana and Punjab the center will be the hub of the Trust's educational and training programs.

As women play a central role in rural agriculture, family development and family health, the courses taught will be geared towards raising their skills in such areas. Through short term courses and seminars women will learn

They will also be educated in prevention health strategies so that they and their families can successfully deal with and combat the increasing use of drugs and the spread of HIV/Aids. It is expected that when the center is fully operational it will provide training to over 1000 women a year.

The Trust has held numerous seminars, workshops and conferences since 2002, bringing farmers together with experts in the fields of the Trusts objectives, policy makers, researchers, private sector and other interested parties.
The seminars have raised the capacity of farmers at the local level by understanding what resources are available to them through government and the private sector.
